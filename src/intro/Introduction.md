Welcome to the Alumet developer book! This book is for plugin developers and Alumet contributors.

Here, you can learn:
- how to make Alumet measure new things (to support a new hardware component, for example)
- how to implement a custom filter or estimation model on top of the measured data
- how to implement new outputs for the data (to support a new database, for instance)
- how to participate in the Alumet project

If you want learn how to use Alumet, for example to measure your energy consumption on CPU and GPU, head over to the [user book](https://alumet-dev.github.io/user-book/).

> This book (and the Alumet project as a whole) is a work in progress.

## Prerequisites

You need to install Rust, Git, and a code editor/IDE.

<div class="warning">

A recent version of Rust is required (**at least 1.76** for now). You can run `rustc --version` to check your version. The easiest way to install a recent version of Rust is to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
</div>

To write Alumet plugins, a basic understanding of the Rust language is required. For simple plugins, you will _not_ need advanced features such as `Send` or `async`. Fundamental notions such as ownership, structures, packages and error handling will be useful.

Are you ready? Let's measure!

## Technical documentation

This book is meant to be a guide for developers. It is not exhaustive and does not document every type nor function that Alumet provide. If you are looking for a particular function or technical feature, please read the [technical documentation of the `alumet` crate](https://docs.rs/alumet/latest/alumet/). It contains additional code examples. It is a good idea to have the documentation open alongside this book.

Note: the "rustdoc" is only updated when a new release of the core of Alumet is released. To obtain the documentation of the latest code, clone the `alumet` repository and run `cargo doc --open`.
